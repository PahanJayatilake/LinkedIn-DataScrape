# Mission
Gather and organize employment history of NanoEngineering alumni after graduation by scraping data from LinkedIn to create a comprehensive database of potential sponsors for the upcoming school year. 

# Message for the Hiring Manager
This project is still in a very early stage and is not near finalization yet. Currently, I have managed to successfully log into LinkedIn automatically and type "NanoEngineering" in the search bar. Additionally, I have not utilized Python for a long duration of time, so this is a project to help me review while allowing me to learn a new skill. Due to me being new at data scraping, I had to utilize several tutorials, but due to the videos being outdated, it made me have to learn the updated versions by myself through reading documentation. While, at first, this didn't seem to make much sense to me, after having to troubleshoot several issues and tie the code into the specific purposes of my project, it helped me to learn so many new things.

# Warning
Data scraping is not supported by LinkedIn. Running this procedure might violate LinkedIn's term of use. So run this program at your own risk. It is reccomended you make an alternate account to avoid the chance of getting banned. This experiment is done only for learning purposes.
