# Mission
Gather and organize employment history of NanoEngineering alumni after graduation by scraping data from LinkedIn to create a comprehensive database of potential sponsors for the upcoming school year. 

# Message for the Hiring Manager
This project is still in a very early stage and is not near finalization yet. Currently, I have managed to successfully log into LinkedIn automatically and type "NanoEngineering" in the search bar. Additionally, I have not utilized Python for a long duration of time, so this is a project to help me review while allowing me to learn a new skill. Due to me being new at data scraping, I had to utilize several tutorials, but due to the videos being outdated, it made me have to learn the updated versions by myself through reading documentation. While, at first, this didn't seem to make much sense to me, after having to troubleshoot several issues and tying the code into the specific purposes of my project, it helped me to understand the functions of the code.

# Warning
Data scraping is not supported by LinkedIn. Running this procedure might violate LinkedIn's term of use. So run this program at your own risk. It is reccomended to make an alternate account to avoid the chance of getting banned. This experiment is done only for learning purposes.

# Installation & Running the Code
For this code to run you will need to download several packages: Selenium, Chrome Webdriver, and BeautifulSoup 4. Additionally, I utilized PyCharm to write this code so maybe it will prove helpful if you utilize it as well. Finally, make sure to past the code as plain text to ensure it will be pasted in the current format.

 ```bash
   pip install selenium
